# Triangle Test

I wrote a function that takes three values (a,b,c) and returns a string detailing what type of triangle it is Equilateral, Isosceles or Scalene.

Should you try and pass a string instead of an integer, or a integer less than 1 the function will return a string saying Invalid.

## Run Tests

- Confirm python is installed on your machine by running `python --version` in your terminal

* If its not installed go to [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download it.

* With python installed run `python test_triangle.py` in the terminal to run the tests found in `test_triangle.py`.
